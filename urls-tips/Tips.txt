The urls are optional. This is an array of links that may interest the user for that area. Some good links will include statistics for the day, so you can know if the most recent live data point is correct. The links are hidden. When the user moves the mouse above the top right corner of the area box (that contains both graph and table) and then moves up pass the border, the link(s) will show up.
