Schedule a Cronjob at your cPanel to pull information from a website's DOM, an API, an external JSON, etc. The scrapping logic would be in that cronjob's county folder's endpoint.php and/or endpoint.js. PHP has an extension that lets you query scrapped website like you can with jQuery. NodeJS will work around the issue of including an external json in PHP being blocked but not blocked because of different domains, by using nodeJS' fetch API.

These are the specific steps on how to use cPanel for Cronjobs:

1. Add New Cron Job
2. Once Per Day
3. For hour, you usually set to a specific hour at the server's local time (You can find the time: ssh -> date command). However on some servers like GoDaddy's, cronjob relies on the timezone you signed up with GoDaddy on rather than local time. You can test what time they use by having a cron job create a different named file at different hours. The file that you see indicates which hour fired off just then.
4. For command, use the appropriate path (can be found via your FTP app) to get to endpoint:

cd /home/bse7iy70lkjz/public_html/tools/covid19/cronjobs/la-county; php -f endpoint.php;

For the seconds, minutes, etc:

That would trigger to run at 8am, 12pm, 3pm, 5pm, and 8pm everyday.
