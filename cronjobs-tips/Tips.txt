Schedule a Cronjob at your cPanel to pull information from a website that does not have a public API. The scrapping logic would be in that cronjob's county code.

1. Add New Cron Job
2. Once  Per Day
3. For hour, set to a specific hour at the server's local time (You can find the time: ssh -> date command)
4. For command, use the appropriate path to get to endpoint:
cd /home/bse7iy70lkjz/public_html/tools/covid19/cronjobs/la-county; php -f endpoint.php;
