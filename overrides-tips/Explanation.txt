Problems:
- The live data may be incorrect. You can override the dates with case numbers to adjust the cumulative cases.
- You may want to add links for specific areas.

Solution:

# Json filename convention
In overrides-data/, you want .json files named after the titles, for example: Los Angeles, California, or Italy. These titles appear at the top of the graphs. It does not have to be completely spelled out. Partial searches will be done for these files, then their json content will be applied over the live data points.

# Json content

{
    "3/18/20": "46",
    "3/17/20": "33",
    "urls": [
        "http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/",
        "https://twitter.com/lapublichealth"
    ]
}

Those dates are overridden by your inputted correct case numbers. The dates must be spelled exactly like they appear on the date columns.

The urls key is optional. This is an array of links that may interest the user. Some good links will include statistics for the day, so you can know if the most recent live data point is correct.
